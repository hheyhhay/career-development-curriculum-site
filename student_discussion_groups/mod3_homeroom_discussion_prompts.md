title: Mod 3 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 3, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (10 mins):
   
   * What was helpful last mod?
   * What do you want to keep doing?
   * What do you want to stop doing?
   * What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. This week's lesson is all about updating your branding materials through revising your resume, creating your Terminal portfolio, and  Read through [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKePxhD-xQdLRPeLI21E71ET_U88ZZ-SKTQjRVzs8tM/edit?usp=sharing) on tips for effective personal and project descriptions and discuss as a group (15 mins):

   * How does this information about how to tailor your descriptions to different audiences make you think differently about the descriptions you've been writing? 
   * What are the main takeaways you'll keep in mind as you refine your personal and project descriptions moving forward?
   * What is challenging about writing these? How could you help each other to overcome those challenges and make your descriptions even better?

3. Pick 1 area to focus on today from the document (GitHub project ReadMe, GitHub profiile ReadMe, Terminal About Me summary, or Terminal project description), and using its tips, create an updated version. (20 mins)

4. Share what you worked on with each other and provide feedback that is specific, actionable, and kind. Make sure to use this feedback to update your materials. (15 mins)

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Discuss (20 mins):
      * What are some ways that you have been networking currently? 
      * What parts of your personal network have you not yet explored? 
      * What are your networking goals for the remainder of this inning? 
3. Take one of the networking goals you mentioned and create an action plan (15 mins):
      * Decide on 1 person to reach out to from a company you are interested in.
      * Use the 3rd tab on [this tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing) to track information on the details for outreach 
      * Draft a message to send. Use [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LeI2exD3jqzdgz5eFs6PLyaSspLCWvnds9VoxVbCFeQ/edit?usp=sharing) of outreach message templates to help you and use the [resources here for finding email addresses](/resources/outreach_networking_resources). You can also consider using LinkedIn or reaching out over Twitter.  
4. Share with your group (10 mins):
      * Who are you reaching out to and why?
      * What are you going to talk about in your message?
      * What questions do you want to ask when you talk to this person?
      * What help could you use from the group to hold you accountable to following through with this outreach?
5. Get final feedback on the messages and send them! (5 mins)
 
### Week 5 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-5"></a>
Today's homeroom is a cover letter feedback workshop with your group. Please bring a cover letter that you're working on to the group. 

1. Revisit norms (5 mins) 

2. Take turns sharing your cover letters with each other. When possible, share the job posting and provide context about the position and company. All group members should provide appreciation and coaching feedback. What is effective about this cover letter? What could make this cover letter more effective? Reminder about best practices for [cover letters from the session](/module_three/week_3_application_process_session) and from [this resource guide](/resources/cover_letter_resources). (40 mins)

3. Assess the feedback you received and make a plan for revision (15 mins):

  * What feedback did your partner give you?
  * What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?
  * If you were to apply to this position (and you should!), how will you customize your resume for it? 
  * What other next steps would you need to take for this application?
