title: Mod 2 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 2, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (15 mins):
  * What was helpful last mod?
  * What do you want to keep doing?
  * What do you want to stop doing?
  * What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. We're going to start looking at resumes this module. While you have probably written a resume before, you'll now focus on highlighting your technical skills and projects. To see what we mean, take some time to look at current student and alumni resumes on [Terminal](https://terminal.turing.edu), our portfolio site. Find 3-5 peer profiles to review. Find their resume by clicking on "open resume" on the left side of the portfolio. As you look through these resumes, discuss (15 mins):
  * What do I like about this resume?
  * What stands out the most?
  * What would I do differently on my resume?
  * What should we keep in mind as we build our new resumes?

3. To help you work on your own resume, let's talk about project descriptions. As a group, discuss how you could describe the current project you're working on in your resume (15 mins) 
  * Sum up the project in 2-3 sentences. What is the objective? What value does it create for users? If someone wasn't familiar with Turing projects, what would they need to know about this to understand it?
  * Sum up the top learning goals and skills you are building in the project. How does building this project make you more valuable as a developer?
  * Think about your own role in the project. How are you contributing?

4. With any remaining time, work on your resume draft using these [resources](/resources/resume_resources).

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Discuss (15 mins):
  * What are some ways that you have already been networking while at Turing?
  * What are some questions you would ask (or have asked) a software developer?
  * Who from the Turing community or your own networks could you reach out to get some of those questions answered? 
3. Work on the 2nd tab of [this tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing) to outline who is already in your network (15 mins).
4. Share with each other (10 mins):
  * What did you learn about your personal network during this activity?
  * Who would be a good person for you to reach out from your tracker? What next steps will you take for this?
  * How can this group help hold you accountable to doing this outreach?
5. Draft an outreach message and share with each other for feedback. Consider sending it on Slack, LinkedIn, or via email -- then hit send! (15 mins)
