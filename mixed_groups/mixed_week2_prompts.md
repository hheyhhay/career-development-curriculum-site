## Overview
You are meeting with your mixed group for one hour today to collaborate on strategies on networking. Below is an outline for how we encourage you to use this time, but we also encourage you as a group to think about what you'd like to accomplish together. 

### Introductions (10 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program & Cohort
* What brought you to Turing?
* How do you feel about your current networking strategies?

### Establishing Group Norms (8-10 mins)
Here are some suggested norms to start with:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can your group members let you know that they value you?

Please discuss any additional norms you would like to set as a group!

### Group Discussion (35 mins)
Please plan to discuss the following topics:

1. **Learning Goals:**

   * Individually, write down one thing you'd like to get out of today's discussion around the topic of networking. If you feel comfortable, please share this intention with the group as you get started. 

2. **Lessons Learned.** As a group, take turns sharing:

   * How are you currently networking? Examples: #lets_grab_donuts, 
   * What has worked well for you?
   * What have you learned? What's the best piece of advice you've gotten?

3. **Group Brainstorm:**

   * As a group, work together to brainstorm a list of all the ways you could approach networking using a [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com/). Think about both how you can network within the Turing commmunity and in the wider industry. If you feel comfortable, please post this list in the #on-campus channel on Slack to share with the community!
   * What types of networking approaches are easiest for you and why? What does this tell you about how you like to connect with others? How could you lean into this more to realize your networking goals?
   * What types of networking approaches are most challenging for you and why? How could you use your strengths to make this a little easier for you to try?

4. **Put it into Practice:*

    * Pick a networking contact from your [networking tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing) to send a message to. For Mod 1 students, think about the networking goal you started on yesterday. 
    * Practice writing out your message to your contact. Consider:
        * How would you 
       

5. **What's next?**

    * Define your purpose: what do you still need to learn?
    * Who should you reach out to help you with that?
    * What are the biggest obstacles to realizing your networking goals? These might include: time, not knowing what to say in your message, ....
    * **Action Step:** Take 5 minutes to...

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Review the learning goals you set out to achieve today. Did you make progress? What are you proud of? What wins can you take away from this conversation today? Finally, how could you continue building relationships with your Mix It Up group outside of today's conversation?
