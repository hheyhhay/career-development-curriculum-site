title: Mix It Up Week 4
subheading: Interviewing Strategies
---

* A lesson where students read questions and consider: What is the underlying question here? For example, "Name a time where you worked on a team and a conflict occurred" is really asking "Are you empathetic?"
* Time for students to prepare 5-10 stories that hit the big umbrella question themes.
* A lesson where students think of what they want to know about a company and then write questions to getting to those answers. For example, if you want to know if you'll be supported/listened to, ask "What does the feedback cycle look like? How often will I get feedback from my manager? How will I be able to give feedback to my manager?" OR if you want to know a company's true values, ask someone who has been at the company for 2+ years, "What has changed about the company since you started? What has stayed the same?"
* Add in time to write their specific stories/examples and practicing their professional story; Add this to Mix It Up group prompts in week 4 to focus interview prep on building your stories + practice their professional stories


## Structuring the Conversation
You are meeting with your mixed group for an hour today to collaborate on goals and strategies for a successful job search. Below is an outline for how we encourage you to use this time, but we also encourage you as a group to think about what you'd like to accomplish together.

### Introductions (10 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program & Cohort
* What brought you to Turing? OR What do you want your career to look like as a software developer?

### Establishing Group Norms (8-10 mins)
Here are some suggested norms to start with:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can they let you know that they value you?

Please discuss any additional norms you would like to set as a group!

### Group Discussion (35 mins)

1. **Learning Goals:**

   * Individually, write down one thing you'd like to get out of today's discussion around the topics of job search goals and strategies. If you feel comfortable, please share this intention with the group as you get started. 

2. **Mod 4 experiences and advice.** Mod 4 students -- please spend a few minutes sharing your experiences working on your job search. 

   * What have you been working on during PD recently? What strategies have been successful for you?
   * What advice do you have for students in earlier modules?    
  
3. **Reflecting on wins and progress.**

   * What wins have you had for your PD and job search so far? What are you proud of? 
   * What progress have you made since you started this career transition?
   * How often do you reflect on your wins? How could you do this more intentionally? 

4. **Creating feasible goals to work towards for the rest of the module.**

   * Based on where you are in your PD and job search journey, what is a goal you'd like to work on for the rest of this module? Why is this goal important for you?
   * What actionable steps could you take for this goal? How will you measure progress?
   * Who or what could hold you accountable?
   * **Action Step:** Take 5 minutes to write down these answers and add anything relevant to your calendar and to-do list.

5. **Discuss challenges to be aware of, resources you can share with each other, and first steps to take.**

   * Based on the goal(s) you shared with the group, what challenges should you be aware of in reaching this goal? What advice or resources does the group have to help you with this challenge?
   * Are there other resources or support within the Turing community that could help you with this challenge? 

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Review the learning goals you set out to achieve today. Did you make progress? What are you proud of? What wins can you take away from this conversation today? Finally, how could you continue building relationships with your Mix It Up group outside of today's conversation?
