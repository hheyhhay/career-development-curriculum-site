Lets walk through your entire resume and review customization to make you stand out and get seen by hiring managers, recruiters and industry profiles. We cant forget the important role the Applicant Tracking or ATS plays in this. We will review how to increase your chances of getting passed it. 


### Section 4: Formatting and the ATS system

Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS, are hiring tools that help medium to large companies sort and screen thousands of resumes. If you've heard of the "resume black hole," then you are already familiar with the concept of how the ATS works. Resumes that are not optimized for an ATS system will not make it through the system to be read by an actual hiring manager.

Each ATS system is different and **it's important to always follow the directions for that specific company**, but there are a few key components to keep in mind when creating a resume that is optimized for ATS systems:

* Use a Word doc or a Google Doc (which can be downloaded as a Word doc) to use as your main copy. Not all ATS systems can read PDFs.
* Use a single column. 
* Compare your resume to the job description and pull out key words to highlight in your skills and experience
* Need some inspiration? Check out these [free resume templates from JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/resume-templates)

### Section 5: What not to include and important resume reminders

When building your resume, here are a few key reminders:

* Double check your spelling, grammar, and readability. How? Read it out loud to yourself to hear how it sounds AND ask a peer or mentor to read it also. As with coding, it never hurts to get a second set of eyes on something.
* Do not lie. This is important. Expect to be asked about **anything** that is listed on your resume. If your resume does not accurately represent you, you will not get this job, and it will hurt your chances at that company in the future.
* List work and education in chronological order. If you're concerned about gaps in your employment, list the length of time at a position rather than the dates.
* Include your contact information. Email is absolutely needed, but you can also include your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. There are differing opinions on phone numbers, but you can decide at your own discretion.
* Don't include a headshot -- it will take up valuable space and it's not a norm in this industry.
* Your resume should only be 1 page. Employers will not read past that 1 page.
* There are a lot of templates you can use, but be conservative with colors. Consider readability and printability.
* Don't list your special interests or hobbies. They don't belong on a technical resume. Instead, you can put them on your LinkedIn profile.

## Check for Understanding (15-30 mins)
Now that you've gained an understanding of how to approach rebuilding your resume, spend some time creating your first draft! Here are some tools to help you:

* Pick a template and use the [checklist here](/resources/resume_resources) to develop a rough draft of your resume
   * Start with a Word or Google doc or use a [Job Scan Template](https://www.jobscan.co/resume-templates)

On Wednesday, you'll have your [Homeroom Group](/student_discussion_groups/mod2_homeroom_discussion_prompts) where you'll discuss more in-depth how to create an effective resume.
