title: Module 2 Professional Development
---

## Overview
Our approach to Mod 2 is to build on the competencies covered in Mod 1 so that students can begin to create a job search and branding strategy as well as learn more about what software development looks like so that they can more clearly define their goals. Mod 2 professional development is delivered through a combination of self-paced asynchronous sessions, small group discussion, office hours, and other check-ins. 

### Key Learning Goals
The following are covered in the Mod 2 curriculum from our 5 core competencies:

* **Networking:**
    * Build on and create new networking strategies to expand your network
    * Utilize networking to conduct research for your new career
* **Interviewing:**
    * Build self-awareness around your background, strengths, values, and goals in order to describe them to others
* **Materials:**
    * Utilize your understanding of your story and your experiences to creatae a resume draft
* **Job Search Strategies:**
    * Combine your values and goals along with tools we'll provide you to create a strong job search strategy

See more about these learning goals [here](/module_two/mod2_learning_goals). 

### Deliverables
By the end of Mod 2, you should have completed:

## Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 2, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_two/m2_pd_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
