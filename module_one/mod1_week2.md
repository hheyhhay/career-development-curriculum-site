It can be helpful to start by assessing where you fall on the introversion-extroversion spectrum to know what types of interactions energize you and what drain you. Often we think that introverts are shy and extroverts are outgoing. But in reality, everyone exists on the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, and our place on that spectrum can change depending on our current circumstances. Check out some of these helpful articles and tools:
