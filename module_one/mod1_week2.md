### Section 2: Assessing your Comfort Level in Networking


Provide examples/extra information

It can be helpful to start by assessing where you fall on the introversion-extroversion spectrum to know what types of interactions energize you and what drain you. Often we think that introverts are shy and extroverts are outgoing. But in reality, everyone exists on the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, and our place on that spectrum can change depending on our current circumstances. Check out some of these helpful articles and tools:

### Section 3: Create Networking Goals

#### Suggested Goal #1: Networking with your Mentor
At this point, you should have already reached out to your mentor to introduce yourself and have a DTR. You may have already met a few times, but it's likely that those conversations were focused on your technical learning. But you can utilize your mentor for so much more! They have been in your shoes and know what it's like to be new to the industry. They are a wealth of knowledge and can provide you with ample advice. To network with your mentor, take the following steps:

* Set up a call with your mentor and let them know you specifically want to talk about their career experience. Provide them with a couple of options for times to talk. 
* Come up with some questions to ask them during the call. It can be helpful to send them the questions ahead of time so they can prepare for the conversation.
* Take notes during the conversation and consider adding them to your [networking tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing).
* Decide on one takeaway from the conversation that you can follow up on. This might mean doing a little research into something they mention or asking for an introduction to someone from their network. 

Suggested questions/discussion prompts:

* Tell me about your background. How did you get started in the tech industry?
* When you were looking for your first software job, what strategies were successful for you? What strategies were not successful?
* What is the number one piece of advice you have for someone like me who is just starting out in this career?
* At your company, what do you look for in junior developers?
* What can junior developers do to help themselves stand out? 
* I'm not sure what industry/companies I'm interested in. Do you have any advice on how I could start to figure that out?
* I know I'm interested in ______ kind of work. Do you have any advice on how I could learn more about that?
* How did you figure out where you wanted to start with your first job? How has that influenced your career?
* Is there anyone you know who would be beneficial for me to talk to? Could you make an introduction for me? 

**Note:** your mentor may also be job searching, perhaps for their first tech job. They are still a great person to network with! They can share all of the strategies they have been trying already so that you can learn from their experience. 

#### Suggested Goal #2: Meet Someone New at Turing
Whether you join a student circle or the #lets_grab_donuts channel on Slack, commit to meeting someone new within the Turing community. 

This could also be another person in the Turing network but who isn't your mentor -- an alum who is in the same Student Circle as you, for example.

Take the following steps to reach out:

* Send a message to this person. If you don't know them personally, take the time to introduce yourself and explain very clearly both what you want to talk to them about and *why* you specifically want to talk to them about this (as opposed to someone else). Why are they the right person for your questions? Provide them with a couple of options for times to talk. 
* Come up with some questions to ask them during the call. It can be helpful to send them the questions ahead of time so they can prepare for the conversation.
* Take notes during the conversation and consider adding them to your [networking tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing).
* Decide on one takeaway from the conversation that you can follow up on. This might mean doing a little research into something they mention or asking for an introduction to someone from their network.

#### Suggested Goal #3: Network with a Contact You Already Know
Reach out to a contact from your existing network and ask to set up a call to discuss career advice. Who would be an ideal person for you to reach out? Someone in the tech industry (not necessarily a developer), someone who has changed careers before, or someone you trust for career advice. Take the following steps to reach out:

* Send a message to this person and explain why you'd like to connect. Why are they the right person for your questions? Provide them with a couple of options for times to talk. 
* Come up with some questions to ask them during the call. It can be helpful to send them the questions ahead of time so they can prepare for the conversation.
* Take notes during the conversation and consider adding them to your [networking tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing).
* Decide on one takeaway from the conversation that you can follow up on. This might mean doing a little research into something they mention or asking for an introduction to someone from their network.

Depending on who you choose to reach out to, your questions will look different. Here are some suggested prompts to get you started:

* Tell me about your background. How did you get to where you are now?
* What does your company do? How does your role contribute to that? 
* What is the number one piece of advice you have for someone like me who is changing careers/starting something new?
* I'm not sure what industry/companies I'm interested in. Do you have any advice on how I could start to figure that out?
* I know I'm interested in ______ kind of work. Do you have any advice on how I could learn more about that?
* How did you figure out where you wanted to start with your first job? How has that influenced your career?
* Is there anyone you would recommend I talk to at your company or in the tech industry at large? Would you be able to make an introduction for me?  

## Check for Understanding
Complete the [final section of the refection sheet for this lesson](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ6eMTKmS0xeLMfmAu1bxZtkQzeIW0BFlye-DlpSkSk/edit?usp=sharing) by creating your networking goal. **This is a deliverable for Mod 1.** <a name="cfu"></a>

## Application
1. You'll meet in your first Mix It Up group this week with students in different cohorts, and the conversation will be focused on networking. Please be prepared to share your ideas about your networking needs, comfort level, and goals.

2. On Friday, you'll see a Slack message in your cohort channel asking you this  question:

    * What did you learn about your networking style this week? What steps will you take towards networking during the rest of the module?
